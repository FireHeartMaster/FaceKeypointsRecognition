# FaceKeypointsRecognition
 It's a simple tool that recognizes keypoints of a human face, as lips, eyes and nose
 
 Using Python I made a jupyter notebook that loads images from dataset, creates a neural network, saves it to a file (so we don't need to re-train the neural net everytime we want to use it) and uses it for real time face keypoint recognition

Dataset used for training is not included in this online repository
